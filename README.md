# Week-9-Assignment-Honeypot
> In this assignment, we had to setup a virtual machine as well as a honeypot, however, I ran into errors with creating them.
## Codepath Installation Guide

I went through Codepath's guide to install the Google Cloud Platform SDK, however, I was not able to make it work. Instead, I used the Windows installer, which allowed for an easy install of the SDK found here: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads

After Installing the SDK, I began to work on setting the MHN virtual Machine and honeypot. This part was a fairly straight process. On Codepath, they put up commands to create the VM and its respective firewall rules. Similar commands could be found on their to generate a honeypot along with its firewall rules
